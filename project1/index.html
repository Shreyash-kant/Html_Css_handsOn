          <h1>Missile Man Of India</h1>
          <p id="para1">
            <strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> (15 October
            1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an
            <strong>Indian aerospace scientist</strong> and statesman who served
            as <strong>the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007</strong>.
            He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics
            and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
            scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
            <strong
              >Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</strong
            >
            and <strong>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</strong> and
            was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
            military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as
            the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
            ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a
            pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
            nuclear test by India in 1974.Kalam was elected as the 11th
            president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
            Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National
            Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he
            returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public
            service after a single term. He was a recipient of several
            prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
            civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute
            of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent
            cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including
            national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in
            his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state
            honours.
